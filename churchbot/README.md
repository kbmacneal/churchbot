This bot is currently not being developed. It is built on top of .net 4.7.1 and is intended to be hosted as a web job on top of Azure. The methods in the other bot should work just fine if copy and pasted into here, but the other files are not compatible.

Note that if you were to try and host this in Azure, you would need to host it on top of a Basic or better web app instance, as the bot needs to run continuously and that tier is the start of the tiers that would allow you to do that.
